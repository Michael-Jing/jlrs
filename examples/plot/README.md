This example shows you how to call PyPlot from Rust.

You can run this example by calling `cargo run`. You must ensure the prerequisites to use jlrs have been met, see the [readme of jlrs](https://github.com/Taaitaaiger/jlrs/blob/master/README.md) for more information. Additionally, the `PyPlot`, `PyCall` and `Plots` packages must have been installed by Julia.

NB: It can take a while before the first plot appears.
