# jl-sys

This crate contains the raw bindings to the Julia C API, these are generated by `bindgen`. You can find the requirements for using `bindgen` in [their User Guide](https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-bindgen/requirements.html).

### Build instructions

#### Linux

The recommended way to install Julia is to download the binaries from the official website, which is distributed in an archive containing a directory called `julia-x.y.z`. This directory contains several other directories, including a `bin` directory containing the `julia` executable.

In order to ensure the `julia.h` header file can be found, either `/usr/include/julia/julia.h` must exist, or you have to set the `JULIA_DIR` environment variable to `/path/to/julia-x.y.z`. The environment variable can be used to override the default. Similarly, in order to load `libjulia.so` you must add `/path/to/julia-x.y.z/lib` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable.
