jlrs is a crate that provides access to most of the Julia C API, it can be used to embed Julia in Rust applications and to use functionality from the Julia C API when writing `ccall`able functions in Rust. Currently this crate is only tested on Linux and Windows in combination with Julia 1.6 and 1.7 and is not compatible with other versions of Julia.

The documentation assumes you're already familiar with the Julia programming language.

An incomplete list of features that are currently supported by jlrs:

 - Access arbitrary Julia modules and their contents.
 - Call Julia functions, including functions that take keyword arguments.
 - Exceptions can be handled or converted to their error message, optionally with color.
 - Include and call your own Julia code.
 - Use a custom system image.
 - Create values that Julia can use, and convert them back to Rust, from Rust.
 - Access the type information and fields of values. The contents of inline and bits-union
   fields can be accessed directly.
 - Create and use n-dimensional arrays. The `jlrs-ndarray` feature can be enabled for
   integration with ndarray.
 - Support for mapping Julia structs to Rust structs that can be generated by JlrsReflect.jl.
 - Structs that can be mapped to Rust include those with type parameters and bits unions.
 - An async runtime is available when the `async-std-rt` or `tokio-rt` feature is enabled,
   which can be used from multiple threads and supports scheduling Julia `Task`s and
   `await`ing the result without blocking the runtime.


## Prerequisites

Julia must be installed before jlrs can be used. Only version 1.6 and 1.7 are supported.

#### Linux

The recommended way to install Julia is to download the binaries from the official website, which is distributed in an archive containing a directory called `julia-x.y.z`. This directory contains several other directories including a `bin` directory containing the `julia` executable.

During compilation, the paths to the header and library are normally detected automatically by executing the command `which julia`. The path to `julia.h` must be
`$(which julia)/../include/julia/julia.h` and the path to the library `$(which julia)/../lib/libjulia.so`. If you want to override this default behaviour the
`JULIA_DIR` environment variable must be set to the path to the appropriate `julia.x-y-z` directory; in this case `$JULIA_DIR/include/julia/julia.h` and `$JULIA_DIR/lib/libjulia.so` are used instead.

In order to be able to load `libjulia.so`, this file must be on the library search path. If this is not the case you must add `/path/to/julia-x.y.z/lib` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. When the `uv` feature is enabled, `/path/to/julia-x.y.z/lib/julia` must also be added to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. The latter path should not be added to the default path because this can break tools currently installed on your system.

#### Windows

Julia can be installed using the installer or portable installation downloaded from the official website. After installation or extraction a folder called `Julia-x.y.z` exists, which contains several folders including a `bin` folder containing `julia.exe`. The path to the `bin` folder must be added to the `Path` environment variable.

Julia is automatically detected by executing the command `where julia`. If this returns multiple locations the first one is used. The default can be overridden by setting the `JULIA_DIR` environment variable. 

Note that while both Julia 1.6 and 1.7 are supported on Windows, several methods are currently unavailable when the LTS version is used.

If you use the MSVC target, you must create two or three lib files using `lib.exe`. The def files required for this can be found in the `defs` folder in the jl-sys crate. To create the lib files, copy the three files from either the `lts` or `stable` folder to the `bin` folder where Julia is installed. Afterwards, open a Developer Command Prompt for VS19 and execute the following commands:

```
cd C:\Path\To\Julia-x.y.z\bin
lib /def:libjulia.def /out:libjulia.lib /machine:x64
lib /def:libopenlibm.def /out:libopenlibm.lib /machine:x64
lib /def:libuv-2.def /out:libuv-2.lib /machine:x64
```

If you use the GNU target these lib files must not exist.

## Features

Much functionality of jlrs is unavailable unless the proper features are enabled. These features generally belong to one of two categories: runtimes and utilities.

A runtime lets you call Julia from Rust, you must enable one of them if you want to embed Julia in a Rust application. The following features enable a runtime:

- `sync-rt`
  This is the sync runtime. The struct `Julia` is available and can be used to initialize Julia on some thread, this instance can then be used from that thread.

- `tokio-rt` and `async-std-rt`
  These are both async runtimes, the first is powered by tokio and the other by async-std. The struct `AsyncJulia` is available and can be used to initialize Julia on another thread. Unlike `Julia`, `AsyncJulia` can be shared across threads. The main additional feature that's available when an async runtime is used is the ability to schedule a new Julia `Task`, which is returned as a `Future` that resolves when this task has completed.

If you're writing a library, either one that will be called from Julia or one that will be used by an application that embeds Julia, no runtime is required.

In addition to these runtimes, the following utility features are available:

- `lts`
  Use the current LTS version of Julia (1.6) instead of the current stable version (1.7).

- `async`
  Enable the features of the async runtime which don't depend on the backing runtime. This can be used in libraries which provide implementations of tasks that an async runtime can execute.

- `jlrs-derive`
  This features should be used in combination with the JlrsReflect.jl package. This package generates Rust bindings for Julia structs, these bindings use the custom derive macros to enable the safe conversion of data from Julia to Rust, and from Rust to Julia in some cases.

- `jlrs-ndarray`
  Access the contents of a Julia array as an `ArrayView` or `ArrayViewMut` from ndarray.

- `f16`
  Adds support for working with Julia's `Float16` type from Rust using half's `f16` type.

- `ccall`
  Julia's `ccall` interface can be used to call functions written in Rust from Julia. No runtime can be used in this case because Julia has already been initialized, when this feature is enabled the `CCall` struct is available which offers the same functionality as the sync runtime without initializing Julia.

- `uv`
  When `ccall` has been enabled, this feature enables the method `CCall::uv_async_send`, which can be used to wake a Julia `AsyncCondition` from Rust.

- `pyplot`
  This feature lets you plot data using the Pyplot package and Gtk 3 from Rust.


## Using this crate

If you want to embed Julia and call it from Rust, you must enable a runtime feature:

`jlrs = {version = "0.13", features = ["sync-rt"]}`

`jlrs = {version = "0.13", features = ["tokio-rt"]}`

`jlrs = {version = "0.13", features = ["async-std-rt"]}`

A `prelude` is available which provides access to most of the structs and traits you're likely to need. When embedding Julia, it must be initialized before it can be used.

If you use the sync runtime, you can do this by calling `Julia::init` which returns an instance of `Julia`. Note that this method can only be called once while the application is running, if you drop it you won't be able to create a new instance but have to restart the application. If you want to use a custom system image you must call `Julia::init_with_image` instead of `Julia::init`.

The async runtimes provide the same methods, `AsyncJulia::init` and `AsyncJulia::init_with_image`, and also add async variants, `AsyncJulia::init_async` and `AsyncJulia::init_with_image_async`. All of these methods return an instance of `AsyncJulia`.

When you're calling Rust from Julia everything has already been initialized. If the `ccall` feature is enabled `CCall` is available which provides the same functionality as the sync runtime.

### Calling Julia from Rust

This section will focus on some topics that are common between the sync and async runtimes.

After initialization you have an instance of `Julia` or `AsyncJulia`, both provide a method called `include` that lets you include files with custom Julia code. In order to create Julia data and call Julia functions, a scope must be created.

When the sync runtime is used this can be done by calling the methods `Julia::scope` and `Julia::scope_with_slots`. These methods take a closure with two arguments, a `Global` and a mutable reference to a `GcFrame` (frame). The first is an access token for global Julia data, the second is used to root non-global data. While non-global data is rooted, it won't be freed by Julia's garbage collector (GC). The frame is created when `Julia::scope(_with_slots)` is called and dropped when it returns. This means that any data rooted in the frame associated with a scope won't be freed by the GC until leaving that scope.

Because `AsyncJulia` is a handle to the async runtime which runs on another thread it's not possible to directly create a scope. Rather, the async runtime deals with tasks. The simplest of these is a blocking task, which can be executed by calling `AsyncJulia::(try_)blocking_task(_with_slots)`. This method accepts any closure `Julia::scope(_with_slots)` can handle with the additional requirement that they're `Send` and `Sync`. It's called a blocking task because the runtime is blocked while executing this task. The other kinds of tasks that the async runtime can handle will be introduced later.

Inside the closure provided to `Julia::scope(_with_slots)` or `AsyncJulia::(try_)blocking_task(_with_slots)` it's possible to interact with Julia. Global Julia data can be accessed through its module system, the methods `Module::main`, `Module::base`, and `Module::core` can be used to access the `Main`, `Base`, and `Core` modules respectively. The contents of these modules can then be accessed by calling `Module::function` which returns a `Function`, `Module::global` which returns a `Value`, and `Module::submodule` which returns another `Module`.

`Value`, `Module`, and `Function` are all examples of pointer wrapper types. Pointer wrapper types wrap a pointer to some data "owned" by the GC. Other important examples of pointer wrapper types are `Array`, `JuliaString` and `DataType`. `Value` wraps arbitrary Julia data, all other pointer wrapper types can always be converted to a `Value`. All pointer wrapper types wrap a type defined by the Julia C API.

In addition to pointer wrapper types there are inline wrapper types. The most important difference between the two kinds of wrapper types is that a pointer wrapper type wraps a mutable type, while inline wrappers wrap immutable types. Examples are primitive types like
`Float32` and `UInt`, the inline wrapper types of these types are their counterparts, `f32` and `usize`.

`Value` provides several methods to allocate new Julia data. The simplest one is `Value::eval_string`, which evaluates the contents of the string passed to it and returns the result as a `Value`. For example, if you evaluate `sqrt(2)` the returned `Value` contains its result.

In practice, `Value::eval_string` is relatively limited. It can be used to evaluate simple function calls like `sqrt(2)`, but it must be parsed, compiled, and can't take any arguments. Its most important use case is importing installed and standard library packages by evaluating an `import` or `using` statement. A more interesting method, `Value::new`, can be used with data of any type that implements `IntoJulia`. This trait is implemented by primitive types
like `i8` and `char`. Any type that implements `IntoJulia` also implements `Unbox` which is used to extract the contents of a `Value`. Because `sqrt(2)` returns a `Float64`, it can be unboxed as an `f64`. Pointer wrapper types don't implement `IntoJulia` or `Unbox`, if they can be created from Rust the provide methods to do so.

It's possible to call anything that implements `Call` as a Julia function. In addition to `Function`, this trait is implemented by `Value` because any Julia value is potentially callable as a function. Functions can be called with any number of positional arguments and can be provided with keyword arguments. Keywords must be provided as a `NamedTuple`, which can be created with the `named_tuple` macro.

Evaluating raw code and calling Julia functions is always unsafe. Nothing prevents you from calling a function like `nasaldemons() = unsafe_load(Ptr{Float64}(C_NULL))`.

As a simple example, let's convert two numbers to Julia values and add them:

```rust
// Initializing Julia is unsafe because it can race with another crate that does
// the same.
let mut julia = unsafe { Julia::init().unwrap() };
let res = julia.scope(|global, frame| {
    // Create the two arguments. Note that the first argument, something that
    // implements Scope, is taken by value and mutable references don't implement
    // Copy, so it's necessary to mutably reborrow the frame.
    let i = Value::new(&mut *frame, 2u64)?;
    let j = Value::new(&mut *frame, 1u32)?;

    // The `+` function can be found in the base module.
    let func = Module::base(global).function(&mut *frame, "+")?;

    // Call the function and unbox the result as a `u64`. The result of the function
    // call is a nested `Result`; the outer error doesn't contain to any Julia
    // data, while the inner error contains the exception if one is thrown. Here the
    // exception is converted to the outer error type by calling `into_jlrs_result`, this new
    // error contains the error message Julia would have shown. Colors can be enabled by
    // calling `Julia::error_color`.
    unsafe {
        func.call2(&mut *frame, i, j)?
            .into_jlrs_result()?
            .unbox::<u64>()
    }
}).unwrap();

assert_eq!(res, 3);
```

#### Async and persistent tasks

In addition to blocking tasks, the async runtimes let you execute async tasks which implement the `AsyncTask` trait, and persistent tasks which implement `PersistentTask`. Both of these traits are async traits.

An async task is similar to a blocking task, except that you must implement the async `run` method instead of providing a closure. This method takes a `Global` and a mutable reference to an `AsyncGcFrame`. This new frame type not only provides access to the same features as `GcFrame` does, it can also be used to call async methods provided by the `CallAsync` trait. These methods schedule a function call as a new Julia `Task` and can be `await`ed until this task has  ompleted. The async runtimes can switch to another task while the result is pending, allowing multiple tasks to progress.

The previous example can be rewritten as an async task:

```rust
use jlrs::prelude::*;

struct AdditionTask {
    a: u64,
    b: u32,
}

// Only the runtime thread can call the Julia C API, so the async
// trait methods of `AsyncTask` must not return a future that
// implements `Send` or `Sync`.
#[async_trait(?Send)]
impl AsyncTask for AdditionTask {
    // The type of the result of this task if it succeeds.
    type Output = u64;

    // The contents of the `run` method can mostly be copied
    // from the previous example.
    async fn run<'base>(
        &mut self,
        global: Global<'base>,
        frame: &mut AsyncGcFrame<'base>,
    ) -> JlrsResult<Self::Output> {
        let a = Value::new(&mut *frame, self.a)?;
        let b = Value::new(&mut *frame, self.b)?;
            
        let func = Module::base(global).function(&mut *frame, "+")?;

        // Here, the `CallAsync::call_async` trait method is
        // used to schedule the function call on another thread.
        // This method can only be used with an `AsyncGcFrame`.
        unsafe { func.call_async(&mut *frame, &mut [a, b]) }
            .await?
            .into_jlrs_result()?
            .unbox::<u64>()
    }
}
```

While blocking and async tasks run once and return their result, a persistent task returns a handle after setting up its initial state. This handle can be shared across threads and used to call its `run` method. In addition to a global and an async frame, this method can use the state and input data provided by the caller.

As an example, let's accumulate some number of values in a Julia array and return the sum of its contents:

```rust
use jlrs::prelude::*;

struct AccumulatorTask {
    n_values: usize
}

struct AccumulatorTaskState {
    array: TypedArray<'static, 'static, usize>,
    offset: usize
}

// Only the runtime thread can call the Julia C API, so the async trait
// methods of `PersistentTask` must not return a future that implements
// `Send` or `Sync`.
#[async_trait(?Send)]
impl PersistentTask for AccumulatorTask {
    // The type of the result of the task if it succeeds.
    type Output = usize;
    // The type of the task's internal state.
    type State = AccumulatorTaskState;
    // The type of the additional data that the task must be called with.
    type Input = usize;

    // This method is called before the handle is returned. Note that the
    // lifetime of the frame is `'static`: the frame is not dropped until
    // the task has completed, so the task's internal state can contain
    // Julia data rooted in this frame.
    async fn init<'inner>(
        &'inner mut self,
        _global: Global<'static>,
        frame: &'inner mut AsyncGcFrame<'static>,
    ) -> JlrsResult<Self::State> {
        // A `Vec` can be moved from Rust to Julia if the element type
        // implements `IntoJulia`. When a new array is allocated it's
        // returned as a `Value` and can be cast to `Array` or
        // `TypedArray`.
        let data = vec![0usize; self.n_values];
        let array = Array::from_vec(&mut *frame, data, self.n_values)?
            .cast::<TypedArray<usize>>()?;
    
        Ok(AccumulatorTaskState {
            array,
            offset: 0
        })
    }
    
    // Whenever the task is called through its handle this method
    // is called. Unlike `init`, the frame that this method can use
    // is dropped after `run` returns.
    async fn run<'inner, 'frame>(
        &'inner mut self,
        global: Global<'frame>,
        frame: &'inner mut AsyncGcFrame<'frame>,
        state: &'inner mut Self::State,
        input: Self::Input,
    ) -> JlrsResult<Self::Output> {
        {
            // Array data can be directly accessed from Rust.
            // TypedArray::inline_data_mut can be used if the type
            // of the elements is concrete and immutable.
            let mut data = state.array.inline_data_mut(frame)?;
            data[state.offset] = input;

            state.offset += 1;
            if (state.offset == self.n_values) {
                state.offset = 0;
            }
        }

        // Return the sum of the contents of `state.array`. To
        // use it as a function argument it must be converted
        // to a `Value` first, which is possible because
        // `TypedArray` is a pointer wrapper type.
        unsafe {
            Module::base(global)
                .function(&mut *frame, "sum")?
                .call1(&mut *frame, state.array.as_value())?
                .into_jlrs_result()?
                .unbox::<usize>()
        }
    }
}
```

### Calling Rust from Julia

Julia's `ccall` interface can be used to call `extern "C"` functions defined in Rust, for most use-cases you shouldn't need jlrs. There are two major ways to use `ccall`, with a pointer to the function or a `(:function, "library")` pair.

A function can be cast to a void pointer and converted to a `Value`:

```rust
use jlrs::prelude::*;

// This function will be provided to Julia as a pointer, so its name can be mangled.
unsafe extern "C" fn call_me(arg: bool) -> isize {
    if arg {
        1
    } else {
        -1
    }
}

let mut julia = unsafe { Julia::init().unwrap() };
julia.scope(|global, frame| unsafe {
    // Cast the function to a void pointer
    let call_me_val = Value::new(&mut *frame, call_me as *mut std::ffi::c_void)?;

    // Value::eval_string can be used to create new functions.
    let func = Value::eval_string(
        &mut *frame,
        "myfunc(callme::Ptr{Cvoid})::Int = ccall(callme, Int, (Bool,), true)"
    )?.into_jlrs_result()?;

    // Call the function and unbox the result.
    let output = func.call1(&mut *frame, call_me_val)?
        .into_jlrs_result()?
        .unbox::<isize>()?;

    assert_eq!(output, 1);

    Ok(())
}).unwrap();
```

You can also use functions defined in `dylib` and `cdylib` libraries. In order to create such a library you need to add

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["dylib"]
```

or

```toml
[lib]
crate-type = ["cdylib"]
```

respectively to your crate's `Cargo.toml`. Use a `dylib` if you want to use the crate in other Rust crates, but if it's only intended to be called through `ccall` a `cdylib` is the better choice. On Linux, compiling such a crate will be compiled to `lib<crate_name>.so`.

The functions you want to use with `ccall` must be both `extern "C"` functions to ensure the C ABI is used, and annotated with `#[no_mangle]` to prevent name mangling. Julia can find libraries in directories that are either on the default library search path or included by setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable on Linux. If the compiled library is not directly visible to Julia, you can open it with `Libdl.dlopen` and acquire function pointers with `Libdl.dlsym`. These pointers can be called the same way as the pointer in the previous example.

If the library is visible to Julia you can access it using the library name. If `call_me` is defined in a crate called `foo`, the following should work:

```julia
ccall((:call_me, "libfoo"), Int, (Bool,), false)
```

One important aspect of calling Rust from other languages in general is that panicking across an FFI boundary is undefined behaviour. If you're not sure your code will never panic, wrap it with `std::panic::catch_unwind`.

Most features provided by jlrs including accessing modules, calling functions, and borrowing array data require a `Global` or a frame. You can access these by creating an instance of `CCall` first. Another method provided by `CCall` is `CCall::uv_async_send`, this method can be used to wake an `Base.AsyncCondition`. In particular, it can be used to write a `ccall`able function that does its actual work on another thread, returns early and then `wait`ing on the async condition from Julia. The advantage of this is that the long-running function will not block the Julia runtime.


# Testing

The restriction that Julia can be initialized once must be taken into account when running tests that use `jlrs`. The recommended approach is to create a thread-local static `RefCell`: 

```rust
use jlrs::prelude::*;
use std::cell::RefCell;
thread_local! {
    pub static JULIA: RefCell<Julia> = {
        let julia = RefCell::new(unsafe { Julia::init().unwrap() });
        julia.borrow_mut().scope(|_global, _frame| {
            /* include everything you need to use */
            Ok(())
        }).unwrap();
        julia
    };
}
```

Tests that use this construct can only use one thread for testing, so you must use `cargo test -- --test-threads=1`, otherwise the code above will panic when a test tries to call `Julia::init` a second time from another thread.

If these tests also involve the async runtime, the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable must be set to a value larger than 2.

If you want to run jlrs's tests, both these requirements must be taken into account, for example: `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=3 cargo test --features jlrs-ndarray,f16,ccall,uv,jlrs-derive,tokio-rt,sync-rt -- --test-threads=1`


# Custom types

In order to map a struct in Rust to one in Julia you can derive `ValidLayout`, `Unbox`, and `Typecheck`. If the struct in Julia has no type parameters and is a bits type you can also derive `IntoJulia`, which lets you use the type in combination with `Value::new`.

You should normally not need to implement these structs or traits manually. The JlrsReflect.jl package can generate the correct Rust struct and automatically derive the supported traits for types that have no tuple or union fields with type parameters. The reason for this restriction is that the layout of tuple and union fields can be very different depending on these parameters in a way that can't be represented by a single Rust struct.

These custom types can also be used when you call Rust from Julia with `ccall`.
