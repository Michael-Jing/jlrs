//! jlrs provides access to most of the Julia C API, it can be used to embed Julia in Rust
//! applications and to use functionality from the Julia C API when writing `ccall`able functions.
//! Currently this crate is only tested on Linux in combination with Julia 1.6 and is not
//! compatible with earlier versions of Julia.
//!
//! The documentation assumes you have at least a basic understanding of Julia's type system.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! An incomplete list of features that are currently supported by jlrs:
//!
//!  - Access arbitrary Julia modules and their contents.
//!  - Call Julia functions, including functions that take keyword arguments.
//!  - Include and call your own Julia code.
//!  - Load a custom system image.
//!  - Create values that Julia can use, and convert them back to Rust, from Rust.
//!  - Access the type information and fields of values.
//!  - Create and use n-dimensional arrays.
//!  - Support for mapping Julia structs to Rust structs that can be generated by JlrsReflect.jl.
//!  - Structs that can be mapped to Rust include those with type parameters and bits unions.
//!  - Offload long-running functions to another thread and `.await` the result with the
//!    (experimental) async runtime.
//!
//!
//! # Generating the bindings
//!
//! This crate depends on jl-sys which contains the raw bindings to the Julia C API, these are
//! generated by bindgen. You can find the requirements for using bindgen in [their User Guide].
//!
//! #### Linux
//!
//! The recommended way to install Julia is to download the binaries from the official website,
//! which is distributed in an archive containing a directory called `julia-x.y.z`. This directory
//! contains several other directories, including a `bin` directory containing the `julia`
//! executable.
//!
//! In order to ensure the `julia.h` header file can be found, either `/usr/include/julia/julia.h`
//! must exist, or you have to set the `JULIA_DIR` environment variable to `/path/to/julia-x.y.z`.
//! This environment variable can be used to override the default. Similarly, in order to load
//! `libjulia.so` you must add `/path/to/julia-x.y.z/lib` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment
//! variable.
//!
//! #### Windows
//!
//! Support for Windows was dropped in jlrs 0.10 due to compilation and dependency issues. If you
//! want to use jlrs on Windows you must use WSL. An installation guide to install WSL on Windows
//! can be found [on Microsoft's website]. After installing a Linux distribution, follow the
//! installation instructions for Linux.
//!
//! # Using this crate
//!
//! The first thing you should do is `use` the [`prelude`]-module with an asterisk, this will
//! bring all the structs and traits you're likely to need into scope. When embedding Julia, it
//! must be initialized before you can use it. You can do this by calling [`Julia::init`] which
//! returns an instance of [`Julia`]. Note that this method can only be called once while the
//! application is running; if you drop it you won't be able to create a new instance but have to
//! restart the application. If you want to use a custom system image, you must call
//! [`Julia::init_with_image`] instead of `Julia::init`. If you're calling Rust from Julia
//! everything has already been initialized, you can use `CCall` instead.
//!
//!
//! ## Calling Julia from Rust
//!
//! After initialization you have an instance of [`Julia`], [`Julia::include`] can be used to
//! include files with custom Julia code. In order to call Julia functions and create new values
//! that can be used by these functions, [`Julia::scope`] and [`Julia::scope_with_slots`] must be
//! used. These two methods take a closure with two arguments, a [`Global`] and a mutable
//! reference to a [`GcFrame`]. `Global` is a token that is used to access Julia modules, their
//! contents and other global values, while `GcFrame` is used to root local values. Rooting a
//! value in a frame prevents it from being freed by the garbage collector until that frame has
//! been dropped. The frame is created when `Julia::scope(_with_slots)` is called and dropped
//! when that method returns.
//!
//! Because you can use both a `Global` and a mutable reference to a `GcFrame` inside the closure,
//! it's possible to access the contents of modules and create new values that can be used by
//! Julia. The methods of [`Module`] let you access the contents of arbitrary modules, several
//! methods are available to create new values.
//!
//! The simplest is to call [`Value::eval_string`], a method that takes two arguments. The first
//! must implement the [`Scope`] trait, the second is a string which has to contain valid Julia
//! code. The most important thing to know about the [`Scope`] trait for now is that it's used
//! by functions that create new values to ensure the result is rooted. Mutable references to
//! [`GcFrame`]s implement [`Scope`], in this case the [`Value`] that is returned is rooted in
//! that frame, so the result is protected from garbage collection until the frame is dropped when
//! that scope ends.
//!
//! In practice, [`Value::eval_string`] is relatively limited. It can be used to evaluate simple
//! function calls like `sqrt(2.0)`, but can't take any arguments. Its most important use-case is
//! importing installed packages by evaluating an `import` or `using` statement. A more
//! interesting method, [`Value::new`], can be used with data of any type that implements
//! [`IntoJulia`]. This trait is implemented by primitive types like `i8` and `char`. Any type
//! that implements [`IntoJulia`] also implements [`Unbox`] which is used to extract the contents
//! of a Julia value.
//!
//! In addition to evaluating raw commands with `Value::eval_string`, it's possible to call
//! anything that implements [`Call`] as a Julia function, `Value` implements this trait because
//! any Julia value is potentially callable as a function. Functions can be called with any number
//! of positional arguments and be provided with keyword arguments. Both `Value::eval_string` and
//! the trait methods of `Call` are all unsafe. It's trivial to write a function like
//! `boom() = unsafe_load(Ptr{Float64}(C_NULL))`, which causes a segfault when it's called, and
//! call it with these methods.
//!
//! As a simple example, let's convert two numbers to Julia values and add them:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use jlrs::prelude::*;
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! // Initializing Julia is unsafe because it can race with another crate that does
//! // the same.
//! let mut julia = unsafe { Julia::init().unwrap() };
//! let res = julia.scope(|global, frame| {
//!     // Create the two arguments. Note that the first argument, something that
//!     // implements Scope, is taken by value and mutable references don't implement
//!     // Copy, so it's necessary to mutably reborrow the frame.
//!     let i = Value::new(&mut *frame, 2u64)?;
//!     let j = Value::new(&mut *frame, 1u32)?;
//!
//!     // The `+` function can be found in the base module.
//!     let func = Module::base(global).function(&mut *frame, "+")?;
//!
//!     // Call the function and unbox the result as a `u64`. The result of the function
//!     // call is a nested `Result`; the outer error doesn't  contain to any Julia
//!     // data, while the inner error contains the exception if one is thrown. Here we
//!     // explicitly convert the exception to an error that is compatible with `?`.
//!     unsafe {
//!         func.call2(&mut *frame, i, j)?
//!             .into_jlrs_result()?
//!             .unbox::<u64>()
//!     }
//! }).unwrap();
//!
//! assert_eq!(res, 3);
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! Many more features are available, including creating and accessing n-dimensional Julia arrays
//! and nesting scopes. To learn how to use them, please see the documentation for the [`memory`]
//! and [`wrappers`] modules.
//!
//!
//! ## Calling Rust from Julia
//!
//! Julia's `ccall` interface can be used to call `extern "C"` functions defined in Rust, for most
//! use-cases you shouldn't need jlrs. There are two major ways to use `ccall`, with a pointer to
//! the function or a `(:function, "library")` pair.
//!
//! A function can be cast to a void pointer and converted to a [`Value`]:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! # use jlrs::prelude::*;
//! // This function will be provided to Julia as a pointer, so its name can be mangled.
//! unsafe extern "C" fn call_me(arg: bool) -> isize {
//!     if arg {
//!         1
//!     } else {
//!         -1
//!     }
//! }
//!
//! # fn main() {
//! let mut julia = unsafe { Julia::init().unwrap() };
//! julia.scope(|global, frame| unsafe {
//!     // Cast the function to a void pointer
//!     let call_me_val = Value::new(&mut *frame, call_me as *mut std::ffi::c_void)?;
//!
//!     // Value::eval_string can be used to create new functions.
//!     let func = Value::eval_string(
//!         &mut *frame,
//!         "myfunc(callme::Ptr{Cvoid})::Int = ccall(callme, Int, (Bool,), true)"
//!     )?.unwrap();
//!
//!     // Call the function and unbox the result.  
//!     let output = func.call1(&mut *frame, call_me_val)?
//!         .into_jlrs_result()?
//!         .unbox::<isize>()?;
//!
//!     assert_eq!(output, 1);
//!     
//!     Ok(())
//! }).unwrap();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! You can also use functions defined in `dylib` and `cdylib` libraries. In order to create such
//! a library you need to add
//!
//! ```toml
//! [lib]
//! crate-type = ["dylib"]
//! ```
//!
//! or  
//!
//! ```toml
//! [lib]
//! crate-type = ["cdylib"]
//! ```
//!
//! respectively to your crate's `Cargo.toml`. Use a `dylib` if you want to use the crate in other
//! Rust crates, but if it's only intended to be called through `ccall` a `cdylib` is the better
//! choice. On Linux, compiling such a crate will be compiled to `lib<crate_name>.so`.
//!
//! The functions you want to use with `ccall` must be both `extern "C"` functions to ensure the C
//! ABI is used, and annotated with `#[no_mangle]` to prevent name mangling. Julia can find
//! libraries in directories that are either on the default library search path or included by
//! setting the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable on Linux. If the compiled library is not
//! directly visible to Julia, you can open it with `Libdl.dlopen` and acquire function pointers
//! with `Libdl.dlsym`. These pointers can be called the same way as the pointer in the previous
//! example.
//!
//! If the library is visible to Julia you can access it with the library name. If `call_me` is
//! defined in a crate called `foo`, the following should work if the function is annotated with
//! `#[no_mangle]`:
//!
//! ```julia
//! ccall((:call_me, "libfoo"), Int, (Bool,), false)
//! ```
//!
//! One important aspect of calling Rust from other languages in general is that panicking across
//! an FFI boundary is undefined behaviour. If you're not sure your code will never panic, wrap it
//! with `std::panic::catch_unwind`.
//!
//! Most features provided by jlrs including accessing modules, calling functions, and borrowing
//! array data require a [`Global`] or a frame. You can access these by creating a [`CCall`]
//! first. Another method provided by [`CCall`] is [`CCall::uv_async_send`], this method can be
//! used in combination with `Base.AsyncCondition`. In particular, it lets you write a `ccall`able
//! function that does its actual work on another thread, return early and `wait` on the async
//! condition, which happens when [`CCall::uv_async_send`] is called when that work is finished.
//! The advantage of this is that the long-running function will not block the Julia runtime,
//! There's an example available on GitHub that shows how to do this.
//!
//!
//! ## Async runtime
//!
//! The experimental async runtime runs Julia in a separate thread and allows multiple tasks to
//! run in parallel. This works by offloading functions to a new thread in Julia and waiting for
//! them to complete without blocking the runtime. To use this feature you must enable the `async`
//! feature flag:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! jlrs = { version = "0.12", features = ["async"] }
//! ```
//!
//! The struct [`AsyncJulia`] is exported by the prelude and lets you initialize the runtime in
//! two ways, either as a task or as a thread. The first way should be used if you want to
//! integrate the async runtime into a larger project that uses `async_std`. In order for the
//! runtime to work correctly the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment variable must be set to 3 or
//! more, or `auto`.
//!
//! In order to call Julia with the async runtime you must implement the either the [`AsyncTask`]
//! or [`GeneratorTask`] trait. An `AsyncTask` can be called once, its `run` is similar to the
//! closures that are used in the examples above for the sync runtime; it provides you with a
//! `Global` and an [`AsyncGcFrame`] which provides mostly the same functionality as `GcFrame`.
//! The `AsyncGcFrame` is required to call [`CallAsync::call_async`] which calls a Julia function
//! on another thread by using `Base.Threads.@spawn` and returns a `Future`. While awaiting the
//! result the runtime can handle another task. If you don't use `CallAsync::call_async` tasks are
//!  executed sequentially.
//!
//! A `GeneratorTask` is more powerful. It has two methods, `init` and `run`, `init` is called
//! when the `GeneratorTask` is started and can be used to prepare the initial state of the
//! generator. The frame provided to `init` is not dropped after it has completed, which means
//! this initial state can contain Julia data. Whenever a `GeneratorTask` is created, a
//! [`GeneratorHandle`] is returned. This handle can be used to call the `GeneratorTask` which
//! calls its `run` method once. A `GeneratorHandle` can be reused and used from different
//! threads.
//!
//! You can find basic examples in [the examples directory of the repo].
//!
//!
//! # Testing
//!
//! The restriction that Julia can be initialized once must be taken into account when running
//! tests that use `jlrs`. The recommended approach is to create a thread-local static `RefCell`:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use jlrs::prelude::*;
//! use std::cell::RefCell;
//! thread_local! {
//!     pub static JULIA: RefCell<Julia> = {
//!         let julia = RefCell::new(unsafe { Julia::init().unwrap() });
//!         julia.borrow_mut().scope(|_global, _frame| {
//!             /* include everything you need to use */
//!             Ok(())
//!         }).unwrap();
//!         julia
//!     };
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! Tests that use this construct can only use one thread for testing, so you must use
//! `cargo test -- --test-threads=1`, otherwise the code above will panic when a test
//! tries to call `Julia::init` a second time from another thread.
//!
//! If these tests also involve the async runtime, the `JULIA_NUM_THREADS` environment
//! variable must be set to a value larger than 2.
//!
//! If you want to run jlrs's tests, both these requirements must be taken into account:
//! `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=3 cargo test -- --test-threads=1`
//!
//!
//! # Custom types
//!
//! In order to map a struct in Rust to one in Julia you can derive [`ValidLayout`], [`Unbox`],
//! and [`Typecheck`]. If the struct in Julia has no type parameters and is a bits type you can
//! also derive [`IntoJulia`], which lets you use the type in combination with [`Value::new`].
//!
//! You should not implement these structs manually. The JlrsReflect.jl package can generate
//! the correct Rust struct for types that have no tuple or union fields with type parameters.
//! The reason for this restriction is that the layout of tuple and union fields can be very
//! different depending on these parameters in a way that can't be expressed in Rust.
//!
//! These custom types can also be used when you call Rust from Julia with `ccall`.
